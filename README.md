# Beta B version 1
My-A.I Project
This is my ongoing A.I that would try to solve as much problems for its users as possible.It would make use of speech recognition, BeautifulSoup , parsing amongst other things to  try to solve real life problems and make life comfortable for its users.
The goal is to eventually make it a full fledged project that would be a full blown A.I 
The microphone is tricky so wait about 1 or 2 seconds after each a.i speech to reply
As its is in process, there are still some modifications to do such as a clean way to end the program once the task has been completed but for now the keywords you can use are:
play <a specific artist artist, song , album etc from youtube>
play music
news -says the summary of the current world news
lookup - finds places or things and then lets you select from those places or things
weather -gives you specific information on the weather and location you want to check
launch program (this command is still in progress)
